### Lab 4
Lab 4 contains the basic minimal nodeJS app,
a new folder has been created "hello_world"
and a basic node package has been created with npm init. 
The author name has been added in the package.json file, and a description has been added to the package.
Index.js would be the entry point to the package, and
a script has been added to the package.json file to run the main app file.
